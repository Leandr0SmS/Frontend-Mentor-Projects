## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I've learned to work with background-position using multiple images.

```scss
.image--div {
    position: relative;
    background-image: url(../images/bg-pattern-desktop.svg),
                      url(../images/illustration-woman-online-desktop.svg);
    background-size: 220%, 103%;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: -38.5rem -18rem, -5rem 5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

IÂ´ll continue to study React and CSS.
