## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Use .map() to collect data from a obj.

```js

const data = [
    {
        main: {
            id: "01",
            heading: "Equilibrium #3429",
            text: "Our Equilibrium collection promotes balance and calm.",
        },
        footer: {
            id: "02",
            author: "Leandro SimÃµes"
        },
        price_time: {
            id: "03",
            price: 0.041,
            time: 3
        },
        avatar: {
            id: "04",
            avatarName: "Jules Wyvern"
        }
    }
]

//extract data creating jsx Price_Time element
const priceTimeData = data.map((obj) => {
    return <Price_Time 
                key={obj.price_time.id}
                price={obj.price_time.price}
                time={obj.price_time.time}    
            />
});

//extract data creating jsx Main element using {obj}
const mainData = data.map((obj) => {
    return <Main
                key={obj.main.id}
                item={obj}/>
});

```

- Adjacent sibling selector, selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.

```CSS

.nft-img:hover + .nft-icon {
    visibility: visible;
} 

```

### Continued development

Leranig more about react.
